Hi , I am Rohan and i an fascinated with coding. I am an intermediate programmer and i want to sharpen my skills so that I
can be a full stack developee and one day contribute to the programming community.
I am interested in learning or improving my skills in a variety of languages such as Python, Javascript, Java, C# ,C++ and C. 
These are the languages I am most familiar with. I do understand however, 
that one must grasp the fundamentals of coding before diving head on into a language. Because after learning the fundamentals, 
its no longer aviut leaenibg coding , its about leaening the syntax and
applyibg/ transferribg knowlewdge while improving problem solving skills.
I am looking forqaed to meeting coding enthusiasts who I can learn from , even teach and collaborate on projects on.
I can be contacted via email rohan.powell36@yahoo.com.

Well...lets get to it then...if I can think it, i can code it.4
