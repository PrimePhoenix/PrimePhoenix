Hi , I am Rohan and I am fascinated with coding. I am an intermediate programmer and I want to sharpen my skills so that I
can be a full stack developer and make meaningful contributiins to the programming community.
I am interested in learning/ improving my skills in a variety of languages such as Python, Javascript, Java, C# ,C++ and C. 
These are the languages I am most familiar with. I do understand however, 
that one must grasp the fundamentals of coding before diving head on into a language. After learning the fundamentals, 
its no longer about learning coding , its about learning the syntax and
applying/ transferring knowledge while improving your problem solving skills.
I am looking forward to meeting coding enthusiasts who I can learn from , even teach and collaborate on projects with.
I can be contacted via email rohan.powell36@yahoo.com.

Well...lets get to it then...if I can think it, i can code it.4
